## What is a test?
* A set of processes aimed at investigating, evaluating and ascertaining the completeness and quality of computer software
* The most concrete form of documentation of expected behaviour for other developers


## Types of tests
* Unit test, if you are testing one small module of your application
* Integration test, if you are testing that multiple modules of your application works properly together
* Acceptance (end-to-end) test, if you are testing whether the flow of your application works as expected
* Load (stress) test, if you are testing your application under typical load or how much load it can handle before it falls over
